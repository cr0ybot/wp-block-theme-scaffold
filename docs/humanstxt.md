# Humans.txt

A `humans.txt` file is included in the root of the theme for crediting the humans and tools created by humans used in your project. The file is linked in the `<head>` and is output at the root of the site (e.g. `example.com/humans.txt`).

Don't forget to update the `humans.txt` file with your own information!
