# Theme.json and Global Styles

A block theme wouldn't be complete without a [theme.json](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-themes/theme-json/) file. This file is used to define the theme's global styles and settings. The scaffold applies some sensible defaults to get you started, focused mainly around typography and color settings.

## Style Presets and Global Style Switcher

The scaffold includes a `styles` folder (not to be confused with `src/styles/`) for alternate global styles. By default, a `dark.json` file is included for handling dark mode styles, and a Global Style Switcher block is included in the scaffold to handle which is displayed by default and switching between the two on the front end.

@TODO: build the Global Style Switcher block.
