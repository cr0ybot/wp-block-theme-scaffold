# Composer

Composer is included for managing PHP dependencies. Included by default are the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) (tweaked in `.phpcs.xml.dist`), [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/), and the [PHP dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) package for managing environment variables.
