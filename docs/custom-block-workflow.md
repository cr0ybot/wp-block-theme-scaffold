# Custom Block Workflow

[GulpWP](https://github.com/cr0ybot/gulp-wp) includes support for compiling custom blocks using the `@wordpress/scripts` package. Custom blocks should be created as subfolders in `src/blocks/` which are transpiled to `dist/blocks/` and automatically enqueued in `includes/blocks.php`.

@TODO: How to scaffold new custom blocks.
